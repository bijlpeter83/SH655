# SH655
This repository contains surface sediment dinocyst assemblage data from the Southern Hemisphere (n=655). This repository belongs to the paper by Lena M. Th√∂le, Peter D. Nooteboom, Suning Hou, Rujian Wang, Senyan Nie, Elisabeth Michel, Isabel Sauermilch, Fabienne Marret, Francesca Sangiorgi, Peter K. Bijl: An expanded database of Southern Hemisphere surface sediment dinoflagellate cysts and their oceanographic affinities, submitted to Journal of Micropaleontology (in review).

The repository contains the dinocyst data file from 655 surface sediments from the Southern Ocean. Although this has in part overlap with previous databases (e.g., Prebble et al., 2013; Marret et al., 2019), some adjustments to those were made, which required us to deposit the full SH_655 here again. It contains 66 new samples, which mostly came from the Antarctic Margin.

It also contains the output of lagrangian particle trace analyses in order to extract from a modern ocean model the oceanographic conditions of the surface water directly overlying the sample sites (surface) and the conditions of the surface waters of the backtracked origins of sedimentary particles (transported). 

Finally, we added the cluster analyses results of various clustering simulations, prescribing the number of clusters.
